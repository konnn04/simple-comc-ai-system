        "-"
      ],

        "the",
        "some"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,

        "or"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "B) 'But' is correct because it introduces a contrast between your preference for video games and your sister's preference for board games. 'And' would suggest similar preferences, 'so' would indicate a consequence, and 'or' would suggest a choice."

        "his",
        "it"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "A) 'He' is the correct pronoun because it's the subject of the verb 'played'. 'Him' is an object pronoun, 'his' is a possessive pronoun, and 'it' is generally used for objects or animals."

        "they're"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "B) 'Then' is correct because it indicates a sequence of actions. 'Than' is used for comparisons, 'that' introduces a clause, and 'they're' is a contraction for 'they are'."

        "me",
        "mine"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "B) 'My' is correct because it is a possessive adjective that modifies 'new game'. 'I' is a subject pronoun, 'me' is an object pronoun, and 'mine' is a possessive pronoun used without a following noun."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the correct article to use when talking about Pho?",

        "in",
        "with"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The correct preposition is \"on\". We say \"on my holiday\" to indicate when the action takes place. Ví dụ: \"I'm going to visit Ha Long Bay on my holiday.\" (Tôi sẽ đi thăm Vịnh Hạ Long vào kỳ nghỉ của tôi.)"
    },
    {
      "question": "My friend from America wants to try 'Banh Mi'. _______ she goes to Vietnam, I will take her to my favourite street food vendor.",

        "He",
        "They"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "\"It\" is the correct pronoun to refer back to a singular, inanimate object, which in this case is the Ao Dai. Ví dụ: \"Lan showed me her Ao Dai. It is very beautiful.\" (Lan cho tôi xem áo dài của cô ấy. Nó rất đẹp.)"

        "Have you like Vietnamese coffee?"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "\"Do you like Vietnamese coffee?\" is the correct way to form a question in the simple present tense. This uses the auxiliary verb \"do\" to form the question. \"Bạn có thích cà phê Việt Nam không?\""

        "so that",
        "but"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "\"So that\" expresses a purpose. The speaker wants to learn about Vietnamese culture *for the purpose of* understanding their girlfriend's family better. Ví dụ: \"I want to learn more about Vietnamese culture so that I can understand my girlfriend's family better.\" (Tôi muốn tìm hiểu thêm về văn hóa Việt Nam để có thể hiểu rõ hơn về gia đình bạn gái tôi.)"

        "an",
        "the",
        "no article"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The correct article is 'a' because 'phone' starts with a consonant sound. 'A' is used before consonant sounds. 'An' is used before vowel sounds. 'The' refers to a specific phone. 'No article' isn't correct here because we're introducing a singular, non-specific phone."
    },
    {
      "question": "She is interested _______ learning about the stock market.",
      "options": [
        "in",

        "on",
        "to"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,

        "if"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The correct conjunction is 'so'. It shows the result of the company's growth. Because the company is growing fast, the consequence is they need to hire more people. 'But' shows contrast, 'or' shows a choice, and 'if' introduces a condition."

      "question": "My friend told me about a new app. _______ downloaded it yesterday.",
      "options": [
        "He",

        "It",
        "They"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The correct pronoun is 'It' because we're referring to the app, which is a thing. 'He' and 'She' are used for people, and 'They' is used for plural subjects or when the gender is unknown or irrelevant."
    },

        "exciting",
        "more excited",
        "most excited"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The correct phrase is 'more excited'. 'Excited' describes a feeling, and we use 'more' with it to show a comparison. 'More excite' is grammatically incorrect, 'exciting' describes something that causes excitement, and 'most excited' suggests being the most excited of a group."
    },

        "Any",
        "Some"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The most fitting pronoun is 'Someone' indicates an unspecified person is performing the action. 'Every' requires a noun ('Every *person*'). 'Any' usually appears in questions or negative statements, and 'Some' requires a noun or a plural verb ('Some *people* watch')."

        "the",
        "a",
        "an",
        "some"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The correct answer is 'an' because 'email' starts with a vowel sound. We use 'an' before words that start with vowel sounds (a, e, i, o, u). 'A' is used before consonant sounds. 'The' is used for specific or known nouns, and 'some' is used for plural or uncountable nouns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are you ___ Instagram?",
      "options": [
        "in",

        "at",
        "to"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The correct answer is 'on'. We use 'on' with social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter (e.g., 'I am on Facebook'). 'In', 'at', and 'to' are not the correct prepositions in this context."

      "options": [
        "some",
        "a",
        "the",
        "any"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The correct answer is 'a' because 'photo' is a singular, countable noun, and it's the first time it's mentioned. Therefore, we use the indefinite article 'a'. 'Some' is used for plural or uncountable nouns. 'The' would imply we're talking about a specific photo, and 'any' is generally used in questions or negative statements."

        "so",
        "or"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The correct answer is 'but'. 'But' is a conjunction used to connect two contrasting ideas. The sentence expresses that she likes chatting online, but she dislikes video calls, which are contrasting preferences. 'And' joins similar ideas, 'so' shows a result, and 'or' presents alternatives."
    },

        "their",
        "our"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The correct answer is 'her' because the subject is 'My sister', who is female. 'Her' is the possessive pronoun that corresponds to a female singular noun. 'His' is for male subjects, 'their' is for plural subjects, and 'our' refers to something belonging to 'us'."
    },

        "anybody",
        "somebody"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 3,
      "explanation": "The correct answer is 'somebody'. It implies that the speaker informed at least one person about the party, without being specific about who they were. 'Everybody' suggests informing all possible recipients, 'nobody' indicates informing no one which contradicts the intent, and 'anybody' usually implies a question such as 'Did I tell anybody?'"
    },

      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,

      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The correct preposition is \"on\" because we use \"work on\" to indicate that someone is doing a specific task or project. The other prepositions (at, in, to) don't fit the context of doing a project."

      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "\"So\" is used to show a result or consequence. Minh wants to study abroad, and as a result, he needs to improve his English. \"But\" indicates a contrast, \"or\" offers a choice, and \"because\" introduces a reason. None of these fit the context as well as \"so\"."

        "They"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The pronoun \"She\" is used to refer to a female. Since Thuy is a female name, \"She\" is the correct pronoun. The other pronouns don't match the gender of the person being referred to."

      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "\"To\" is used to express purpose or reason. In this sentence, \"to study\" explains why they are going to the library. \"For\" is also acceptable, but less common at the beginner level. \"at\" and \"in\" are not grammatically correct in this context."

      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "\"But\" is used to introduce a contrast or something unexpected. The sentence states the computer is old, but surprisingly, it still works well.
